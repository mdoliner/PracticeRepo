I grew up in a family where such questions were considered rude and I never knew how to respond. Later I’d entertain myself thinking up retorts but never mustered the courage to use them: “I make a million or so a week and my rent-controlled apartment is so cheap I hardly notice. Now may I inspect your breasts?”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut that was then and this is now.

He said that ethical salesmen \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/164356/why-business-schools-charge-so-much-and-pay-their-teachers-so-little/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eact in the customers’ best interests\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHe also told me to be careful about reading the news because salesmen face rejection on a daily basis and if you slather the top of that with what the media feeds us then you might conclude that life isn’t worth living.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat is when I stopped paying much attention to the news and my life has improved immeasurably since. I like to go to bed exhausted from my work or stay up celebrating my accomplishments rather than feeling like I’m not successful enough or fretting because I imagine the world sucks and there is nothing I can do.

Temptations were ubiquitous, and my self-control was fading one cupcake at a time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESelf-control is more crucial today than it has ever been. According to Daniel Akst, author of \\u003Cem\\u003EWe Have Met the Enemy: Self-Control in an Age of Excess\\u003C/em\\u003E, “It\\u0026#8217;s not that we have less willpower than we used to, but rather that modern life immerses us daily in a set of temptations far more evolved than we are.” Fast food restaurants beckon at every corner and entertainment options have become limitless. These trends are not going to reverse—it’s our behavior that must change.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe annual Stress in America survey shows that lack of willpower is consistently cited as \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower.aspx\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ethe top obstacle\\u003C/a\\u003E to lifestyle changes. I wanted to improve my lifestyle, but how would I develop willpower?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EArmed with Roy Baumeister and John Tierney\\u0026#8217;s \\u003Cem\\u003EWillpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength\\u003C/em\\u003E, which discusses decades of experiments on self-control, I designed my own year-long experiment where each month consisted of a different willpower challenge.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EJanuary\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMy task for January was to make one—and only one—resolution for each month of 2014. A litany of New Year’s resolutions is bound to fail, and the resulting sense of defeat becomes a roadblock in the path to self-improvement. The monthly tasks were tailored to my personal development goals and to special events in 2014—including a new job and my sister’s wedding.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENote that I did not make a list of New Year’s resolutions. According to Baumeister, \\u0026#8220;Because you have only one supply of willpower, the different New Year\\u0026#8217;s resolutions all compete with one another. Each time you try to follow one, you reduce your capacity for all the others.” Those who make just one New Year’s resolution are more likely to succeed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EFebruary\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFebruary was a month of no chocolate. But how could I shun my favorite food in the world? I was convinced I would fail. To improve the odds, I signed \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.stickk.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ea commitment contract on stickK.com\\u003C/a\\u003E where every time I tasted the forbidden treat, a $20 donation would go to charity. And here’s the rub: it would go to a charity whose mission I despised. According to stickK.com, people who draw up a contract \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/need-fresh-start-heres-begin/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ewithout a financial penalty\\u003C/a\\u003E succeed only 35% of the time, whereas those with a penalty triumph 78% of the time. Then I assigned my fiancé as a referee—he independently reported on my progress every week. Involving others makes a huge psychological difference since \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.influenceatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/E_Brand_principles.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Epublic commitment influences behavior\\u003C/a\\u003E more than a private promise.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe results? I erred only once—on the first day—when I instinctively lunged at a chocolate chip cookie. And I couldn\\u0026#8217;t hide it from my fiancé since I had snatched the cookie from his fingers. It\\u0026#8217;s the most expensive cookie I\\u0026#8217;ve ever had—after factoring in the $20 donation to the National Rifle Association (NRA). After that it became surprisingly easy to refrain from chocolate.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EMarch\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBuoyed by the relative success of my first resolution, I challenged myself again in March. This time, I would change my nocturnal nature by waking up at 6a.m. every weekday rather than my natural waking hour of 8a.m. The goal was too ambitious. I managed for the first two days and consistently failed after that. For the rest of the month, I woke up every day knowing that I had failed before the day even started. It was an awful feeling.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s a good idea to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4165760?sid=21104929177471\\u0026amp;uid=2\\u0026amp;uid=4\\u0026amp;uid=3739600\\u0026amp;uid=3739256\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ebuild early success\\u003C/a\\u003E by setting easier goals at the start. Willpower increases with effort and I didn\\u0026#8217;t have it just one month into the experiment. Close to giving up, I wrote off March as a failure. I would give the experiment one more month.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EApril\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMy April goal was a deliverable, as opposed to a change in behavior. I never had time to write, and my resolution was to pen an article I was proud of. Incredibly, once I set my one and only goal for that month, I also found the hours. I wrote on the bus, train, plane—anywhere, anytime. I blew past my goal and ended up writing two articles. Both were rejected by editors, but so what? I was still proud of them. Writing has become a lasting habit since that resolution in April showed me just how much I enjoy it. The success renewed my faith in the merits of willpower, and I was back on board.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EMay\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs spring showed its colors, I wanted to freshen my own colors. I had become lazy in the winter months about dressing well and wearing make-up, and so my goal for May was to look my best every day. It was perfect timing since I had many appearance-sensitive events that month, including a weekend with my future in-laws. I dreaded they would ask me, \\u0026#8220;Do you ever change your clothes?\\u0026#8221; Empirical research showed that the real problem was not laziness, but a lack of glucose when I woke up in the morning. Self-control makes the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-brain-uses-glucose-to-fuel-self-control-1417618996?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsThird\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Efrontal cortex of the brain\\u003C/a\\u003E work hard, and the brain consumes 25% of the body’s circulating glucose. So when your glucose is low, it’s much harder to exercise willpower. Basically, I would skip breakfast and then have no energy to spend 15 extra minutes on looking good. The fix was easy: I grabbed a soy yogurt from the fridge right after I woke up. Problem solved.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EJune\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENow that I looked good again, it was time to dance. My sister’s wedding was at the end of June, and she requested I perform three choreographed dances in front of 400 people. I feel awkward even dancing in front of the mirror. So my June resolution was to focus on her wedding. Even though I complained daily about rehearsing for two hours every day, this was actually the most satisfying goal of the year. Nothing compares to the joy of making someone you love happy. She was so thrilled with my efforts that she cried (if I hadn’t made the resolution, then she might have been in tears about the terrible dancing). As \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/opinion/sunday/arthur-c-brooks-love-people-not-pleasure.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ethis New York Times article on happiness\\u003C/a\\u003E states, “Few things are as liberating as giving away to others that which we hold dear.\\u0026#8221; Time was my scarcest resource, and I gave it to my sister.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EJuly-October\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe next four months continued in the same vein. I improved my productivity at work in July (success), read five books in August (success), tried to be spend more time with my fiancé in September (failure), and aimed to cook 10 times in October (missed by two).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003ENovember\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn November, my resolution was to skip coffee. It was similar to the February goal of no chocolate—but I no longer needed a referee or a financial penalty. After nine months of practice, I had developed the willpower to break an addiction. Yes, it was challenging to step off a red-eye flight and go straight to the office. But I did it. Resisting the temptation was easier after I hid the coffee in my apartment as well as the loyalty card to my favorite café. Walter Mischel, designer of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Marshmallow-Test-Mastering-Self-Control/dp/1469249065\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ethe renowned Marshmallow Test\\u003C/a\\u003E, found that children who successfully refrained from eating the marshmallow did so by distracting themselves or covering their eyes. Those who kept looking at the marshmallow succumbed to the temptation. Removing coffee from my immediate vicinity paved the road to success.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is obvious that my behavior has changed since the experiment began in February. I now work out twice a week and have no difficulty turning down dessert. After a long work week, I make the time to write and volunteer in the evenings and weekends. And the icing on the non-cake is that it is no longer a struggle. I am not fighting myself anymore since my thoughts and actions are aligned with each other.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe monthly resolutions were supposed to stop at the end of 2014, but I gained so much from them that I will continue in 2015. Baumeister is correct that “Exercising self-control in one area seemed to improve all areas of life.\\u0026#8221; The challenges will evolve as my personal goals change, and the journey to greater self-control will continue.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EFollow Sofia on Twitter \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/sofiafaruqi\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E@\\u003Cspan class=\\\"u-linkComplex-target\\\"\\u003ESofiaFaruqi\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=319015\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/319015/why-you-should-make-a-resolution-each-month-instead-of-each-new-year/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-12-30T06:30:46-05:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=319015\",\"dc_creator\":\"Sofia Faruqi\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/donutbox.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"donutbox\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/donutbox.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/319015/why-you-should-make-a-resolution-each-month-instead-of-each-new-year/"], ["published_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 11:30:46 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why you should make a resolution each month instead of each new year"], ["updated_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 14:31:52 UTC +00:00]]

Three hundred and fourteen MPs (58%) were elected for the first-time to the Lok Sabha in the 2014 general elections.

Actor Kal Penn, who played the role of Kumar, actually \\u003Cem\\u003Eis\\u003C/em\\u003E a vegetarian, and reportedly consumed veggie sliders instead of the beef ones while shooting the film. The veggie sliders debuting today will bear no relation to the ones used on the Harold and Kumar set, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2014/09/26/white-castle-testing-veggie-burger.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERichardson told the Columbus Dispatch\\u003C/a\\u003E in September.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhite Castle\\u0026#8217;s veggie sliders are made by Dr. Praeger\\u0026#8217;s, a health food company based in New Jersey.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhite Castle, a family-owned business based in Columbus, Ohio, chose to work with Dr. Praeger\\u0026#8217;s because it\\u0026#8217;s family-owned, too, says Richardson. The sliders sell for 99 cents, which is slightly more expensive than the beef ones, which are priced closer to 75 cents in most markets.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEach White Castle restaurant has a special grill just for the veggie sliders, with green spatulas that aren\\u0026#8217;t supposed to touch any other food.

Richardson\\u0026#8217;s favorite is sweet Thai, but he also thinks the sliders taste great with no sauce at all: They are \\u0026#8220;really, really flavorful and mighty tasty,\\u0026#8221; he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe hope is that they also will appeal to customers, and in particular to millennials, whom Richardson describes as having shown \\u0026#8220;an interest in more menu options and variety.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=319178\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/319178/white-castle-starts-selling-veggie-burgers-today/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-12-30T10:59:55-05:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=319178\",\"dc_creator\":\"Svati Kirsten Narula\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/rtr7jl9.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RTR7JL9\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/rtr7jl9.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/319178/white-castle-starts-selling-veggie-burgers-today/"], ["published_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 15:59:55 UTC +00:00], ["title", "White Castle starts selling veggie burgers today"], ["updated_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 16:28:36 UTC +00:00]]

We need to resolve to make better resolutions!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnhealthy habits are what we do to distract from uncomfortable emotions that we don\\u0026#8217;t know what to do with: anger, sadness, loneliness, boredom, and guilt. Eating your emotions is a great example of how we use a behavior to distract from what we are feeling. But resolving to stop the distracting behavior without first finding out what\\u0026#8217;s motivating it is dooming yourself to failure. Only when we acknowledge what\\u0026#8217;s driving us can we make a conscious decision to change a behavior.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne of my clients summed it up nicely: \\u0026#8220;I had it all backwards. I thought that if I lost weight I would happy. Once we started working with my emotions, I realized it\\u0026#8217;s the other way round. When I am happy, I am healthier—and not just with food.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EResolve to reconnect with your emotional self this year. Here are three simple but powerful practices that will help you create change from the inside out:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E1. Practice emotional awareness\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHow often do you stop and ask, \\u0026#8220;What am I feeling?\\u0026#8221; At first, the answer may be \\u0026#8220;I don\\u0026#8217;t know!\\u0026#8221; and that\\u0026#8217;s OK. Be patient, be curious, and keep feeling. If you are used to ignoring how you feel or shutting down to the point of numbness, it may take a little while to reconnect. Confused by what you\\u0026#8217;re feeling? You may be feeling more than one emotion. Don\\u0026#8217;t try to think too much, just feel.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen is the best time to ask yourself how you’re feeling? When an unhealthy habit tempts you. Reaching for the bag of chips? Have the urge to pour a drink? Stepping out for a smoke? Stop! Ask yourself how you are feeling. Angry? Stressed? Bored? Sad? Once you acknowledge what you are actually feeling, then you can make conscious choices about how to satisfy the feeling instead of covering it up. And remember, it can be just as uncomfortable to feel positive emotions. Eating your happiness is no better than eating your sadness. Practice basking in feelings of happiness, joy, pride, and excitement without having to distract with unhealthy behavior.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the end we can’t fix what we aren’t aware of. By practicing emotional awareness, you may be surprised to find what is truly motivating your unhealthy behaviors.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E2. Practice emotionally refueling\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe are so busy and our hectic pace leaves us mentally and emotionally overwhelmed and exhausted. Our emotions need a break. We all have small things that help us feel refueled—a morning to sleep in, an hour to ourselves, a run, date night, or a chat with a friend.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMake a list of the things that leave you feeling joyful, rested, rejuvenated and renewed. The list shouldn\\u0026#8217;t include anything that is a chore or a \\u0026#8220;should,\\u0026#8221; only things you enjoy doing or think you might enjoy doing. Schedule one of these activities at least once a week, give it as much weight as any other appointment and don\\u0026#8217;t let other people or activities encroach upon it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERemember, we cannot give what we do not have. Make refueling your emotional reservoir a priority and see how much more you have to give to the world when you take the small amount of time you need to care for yourself.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E3. Practice gratitude\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EResearch from the Greater Good Science Center at U.C. Berkley has found that gratitude not only benefits us emotionally, but also mentally and physically. When we practice gratitude, we increase the level of activity in our hypothalamus, which is the part of the brain that controls many bodily functions, including metabolism, sleeping, and stress level. That is why gratitude can boost our immunity, improve sleep, and decrease depression. Practicing gratitude also leads to stronger relationships and greater feelings of generosity and connection. It\\u0026#8217;s healthier for you and your community.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s easy to start incorporating gratitude in your life, here are a few ways:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EKeep a gratitude journal and write three things that you are grateful for everyday. There is no such thing as something too small or simple to be grateful for.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003ETell your significant other one thing you appreciate about them every day.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EWrite thank you notes. It can even be an email just to tell someone how much you appreciate them.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe more you train yourself to look for the blessings in your life, the more blessings you will find. And when you feel good about yourself and your life, you\\u0026#8217;ll be more likely to choose positive, healthy behaviors.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGet it right this year. Resolve to pay attention to your emotional well-being and you\\u0026#8217;ll be on the road to lasting change. Your emotions hold valuable information that can help you to make the changes you need to create the life you want. Instead of those tired, old resolutions you\\u0026#8217;ve made in past, start 2015 with a question: How am I feeling?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=319465\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/319465/why-our-new-years-resolutions-are-all-wrong/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-12-30T11:53:04-05:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=319465\",\"dc_creator\":\"Alexcis Spencer Lopez\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/gratitudeyoga.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"gratitudeyoga\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/gratitudeyoga.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/319465/why-our-new-years-resolutions-are-all-wrong/"], ["published_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 16:53:04 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why our New Year&#8217;s resolutions are all wrong"], ["updated_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 17:07:50 UTC +00:00]]

They chat about the stresses and rewards of getting back in shape. They tease, they flatter \\u0026#8212; maybe they even flirt a little. They connect with their clients in a way that builds people\\u0026#8217;s motivation. Before long, clients keep coming back to the gym because they want to spend time with a friend, and to do something extra to win his or her respect.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s the same story in health care or education. Technology can monitor an adult\\u0026#8217;s glucose levels or a young child\\u0026#8217;s counting skills quite precisely. Data by itself, though, is just a tool. The real magic happens when a borderline diabetic or a shy preschooler develops enough faith and trust in another person to embark on a new path. What the BLS data tells us is that even in a rapidly automating world, we can\\u0026#8217;t automate empathy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELast week, when the BLS reported that the US economy \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/07/liveblogging-the-may-jobs-report/#liveblog-entry-47562\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eadded 175,000 jobs\\u003C/a\\u003E in May, analysts noted that one of the labor market\\u0026#8217;s bright spots involved restaurants and bars. Waiters, cooks and bartenders accounted for a full 16% of the month\\u0026#8217;s job growth. As the Washington Post\\u0026#8217;s Neil Irwin put it, \\u0026#8220;A robot may be able to assemble a car, but a cook still grills burgers.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EActually, it\\u0026#8217;s the people in the front of the restaurant—and behind the bar—that should command our attention. The more time we spend in the efficient but somewhat soulless world of digital connectivity, the more we will cherish a little banter with wait-staff and bartenders who know us by name. We will pay extra to mingle with other people who can keep the timeless art of conversation alive.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=319487\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/319487/in-2020-this-will-be-the-most-important-job-skill/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-12-30T11:39:32-05:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=319487\",\"dc_creator\":\"George Anders\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/ap635641626080.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Free-hugs\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/ap635641626080.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/319487/in-2020-this-will-be-the-most-important-job-skill/"], ["published_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 16:39:32 UTC +00:00], ["title", "In 2020, this will be the most important job skill"], ["updated_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 17:07:50 UTC +00:00]]

First, it was Venezuela, which offered a sad spectacle for years as its economy disintegrated and collapsed. Then, it was Russia, which is on the verge of staging something nasty and self-destructive, like defaulting or falling into a financial crisis. Then, a most bizarre event: the collapse of a country that is a victim of plummeting prices, without having ever been a big oil producer. Cuba is a victim because the country that kept her going, Venezuela, went broke.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe first two have gone through humbling ordeals. Venezuela has been forced to stop buying political wills all over Latin America to support its populist ideology, the Socialism of the 21st Century. Russia, which plays in a much larger and important league, had to abandon its intentions to swallow its neighbors. None of them, however, has suffered as disgracing a humiliation as that which Cuba has been forced to inflict on herself: to come close to the country Fidel and Raul Castro have called “The Empire”, which they swore to fight without giving or expecting quarter until seeing it to its death, to come close to it and humbly ask to be allowed to enter…well, The Empire — which is entering the American economic sphere of influence, opening itself to American investors, asking to be allowed to sell its wares in the American markets, asking to be allowed to receive more remittances that the Cubans living in the United States send to their families in Cuba…and begging to have the embargo removed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe Parasitic Country\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA drastic fall in the oil prices is all that was needed to push Cuba to betray all its rhetoric of class warfare and bloody revolutions. This is not surprising. It is not the first time that Cuba finds itself destitute, looking for some allowance from another country because it cannot subsist on its own means. The Castro brothers and the Communist Party destroyed the Cuban economy shortly after they staged their revolution in the late 1950s. Since then, Cuba has needed sponsors.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis didn’t seem to be a problem at the time because the Soviet Union was more than pleased to provide for the survival of the indigent island in exchange for five advantages that Castro could offer: the presence of the Soviet military 240 miles from Key West; Castro’s willingness to act as a soldier of fortune on behalf of the Soviet Union, sending his army and personnel to faraway places like Angola; a physical base for sedition against the United States in Latin America; the charisma and rhetoric of Castro and his revolutions; and, for just a short while, a platform for nuclear missiles aimed at the United States.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn this way, the island survived for the next three decades just because the Soviet Union passed it an allowance in the shape of subsidized oil, a good portion of it to be sold by Cuba in the international markets, keeping the profits.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHowever, in the early 1990s the Soviet Union died and its heirs refused to keep on paying for Cuba’s maintenance. The magnitude of the adjustment can be appreciated by looking at the next graph. The country’s estimated Gross Domestic Product per capita came down by 36% between 1989 and 1993. The Castros forced the Cubans to adjust by tightening further their already tight belts. To force the Cubans into such an adjustment the Castros worsened repression drastically.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-319586\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"319586\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F319582%2Flatin-american-communism-rip-born-1917-moscow-died-2014-havana%2Fi%2F319586%2F\\u0026text=Latin+American+Communism%2C+RIP+%28born+1917%2C+Moscow+%E2%80%93+died+2014%2C+Havana%29\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F319582%2Flatin-american-communism-rip-born-1917-moscow-died-2014-havana%2Fi%2F319586%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/cuba-gdp-per-capita-constant-2005-us-value_chartbuilder.png?w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/cuba-gdp-per-capita-constant-2005-us-value_chartbuilder.png?w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"/\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECuba limped for a few years with some help from European friends. Then, luck came Cuba’s way in the shape of Hugo Chavez, who wanted to stage a revolution in Venezuela. Cuba had a decisive competitive advantage for him. Through the years of Soviet servitude, the Cubans had learned some trades that he could use to his advantage: the considerable abilities to spy, misinform and stage conspiracies they had acquired from the KGB, their knowledge of the political and military environments in Latin America, their connections with the revolutionaries in those countries, their ability to project themselves all over the region through social workers and political advisors and their sizeable political skills. That is, the Cuban Communist Party had become a high-powered revolutionary contractor, complete with a territory strategically located and all the advantages that owning a country may provide.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EChavez struck a deal with the Cuban communists. In exchange for a huge yearly subsidy, the Cubans would provide Venezuela with a full menu of revolutionary and strategic services.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe precise amount that Venezuela transferred to Cuba through the years is not currently known. According to Carmelo Mesa, a distinguished professor at the University of Pittsburgh, during the oil booming years Venezuela provided up to US$9.4 billion per year to close the gap in Cuba’s accounts. It did so through many different channels, including the sale of oil at highly subsidized prices, the provision of funds for specific investment projects and the hiring of tens of thousands of medical personnel now working in Venezuela.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThus, Venezuela gave employment to people who would be unemployed in Cuba. Since the workers receive only a minor fraction of the large sums that Venezuela pays for them (US$5.6 billion per year), Venezuela also transferred money directly to the Cuban government. Moreover, the usefulness of the Cuban workers is doubtful. The project these medical workers staffed, Barrio Adentro, (whose name can be loosely translated as Into the Neighborhoods) is coming apart at the seams. By December 2014 it was estimated that 80% of the Barrio Adentro \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Barrio_Adentro\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eestablishments\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=345051\\u0026amp;CategoryId=10717\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ewere\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://thedialogue.org/PublicationFiles/CubaVenezuelaandtheAmericasAChangingLandscape.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eabandoned\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut the Cubans did many other things for Chavez, supporting his every initiative in all international forums and praising him in every available occasion. In fact, Chavez had bought the entire country, which worked for him.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWith time, however, something extraordinary, although perhaps predictable, happened. To take advantage of their abilities, Chavez allowed the Cubans to penetrate deeply into the most intimate circles of power in Venezuela. This was a dangerous move. After Chavez’s death it became apparent that the effective power of Venezuela had been transferred to Cuba. It was there where the main decisions were taken. The Cuban political presence in Venezuela became overwhelming. Cuba became the parasitic head of Venezuela, using its ideological and political power to extract resources from its host.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd then, Venezuela went all but bankrupt, leaving Cuba helpless again. The withdrawal of Venezuela’s support will force an adjustment in the income per capita at least as severe as that of the 1990s.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThus, realistically facing starvation, Cuba had to find another way out. Getting into the American economic sphere is the Cubans’ only option. Renewing diplomatic relations was the first step to enter this new path.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe United States, however, will not provide the support that Cuba is used to get from other countries. Having only one core ability, that of staging revolutions, it has nothing to offer the United States. To survive, Cuba will have to do something that the Communist Party, like all parasites, does not like to do: to produce something. To do that, Cuba will have to reform its system. Like Russia, like China, like Vietnam and so many other formerly communist countries, it will have to swallow its pride and reintroduce capitalism. The reconciliation with the United States is part of this process, which has already started.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe End of Charisma\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe decision that Cuba has taken marks an irreversible step in its history. It will not be able to go back to its role as parasitic contractor of revolutions. Of course, now there is no country that would take it as a teacher or manager of repressive methods and anti-American effervescence. All its potential customers — like Kirchner’s Argentina, Morales’ Bolivia, Correa’s Ecuador, Ortega’s Nicaragua — are bankrupt or in the process of becoming so. All of them depend on oil and commodity exports, and are struggling to adapt their dwindling economies to the new world of low commodity prices.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut, more fundamentally, the Cuban leaders lost face as revolutionaries, irretrievably so because they have joined hands with what for them was the incarnation of evil, the enemy they had to kill to ensure the progress of the masses toward the Communist Paradise. They based their competitive advantage on planting hatred against the United States and capitalism, and on being uncompromising on this hatred. They predicted the fall of capitalism and The Empire uncountable times over five and a half decades. They advised leftist movements all over Latin America to reject as treason the formation of commercial blocks with the United States, saying that forming them strengthened The Empire.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENow, how can they tell these very same people that capitalism and the United States have not fallen and, instead, have seen the collapse of the Soviet Union and all the Communist countries except Cuba and North Korea in the 1990s, and now the collapse of Cuba as well? How to explain that all the things they said marked the path to the future — Communism, the Soviet Union, the Socialism of the 21st Century, the Venezuela of Chavez and Maduro — are dead? Worse still, how will they tell their revolutionary clientele not only that The Empire has not fallen but also that Cuba wants to join it, though they are not using the same term this time?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThus, Cuba’s renewal of diplomatic ties with the United States and the mere fact that it is looking for the elimination of the embargo mark the end of Cuban revolutionary charisma. With its disappearing charisma, Cuba is losing the competitive advantage it had to be a parasitic manager of rogue states.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWith time, Cuba’s revolutionary clients and their movements will fade. They no longer have a country to support them in their daily fights. They have no human symbols. They have no living ideology. They have no charisma, and what had they had in addition to charisma in all these fifty-five years? They have only the sour taste in their mouths that they were left holding the bag of a loser ideology.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is fine and proper that this is happening. This is the completion of a process that started in the late 1980s with the decline and fall of the Soviet Union, and which should have been finished a long time ago if Hugo Chavez had not intervened. Communist Cuba pertained to the old twentieth century, that century of class wars and flamboyant revolutionary caudillos promising freedom and progress while delivering repression and death. That century had to be closed, and this closed it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s the end of an era in Latin America, even if most of the population in the United States, those away from Florida, will not feel any change in their lives, except, maybe, experiencing the pleasure of legally smoking a Cuban cigar.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=319582\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/319582/latin-american-communism-rip-born-1917-moscow-died-2014-havana/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-12-30T14:16:03-05:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=319582\",\"dc_creator\":\"Manuel Hinds\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/ap8904030611.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"AP8904030611\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/12/ap8904030611.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/319582/latin-american-communism-rip-born-1917-moscow-died-2014-havana/"], ["published_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 19:16:03 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Latin American Communism, RIP (born 1917, Moscow – died 2014, Havana)"], ["updated_at", Tue, 30 Dec 2014 19:20:34 UTC +00:00]]
